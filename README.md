# Touhou Pixel Dungeon: Reloaded

For some reason, this game seems like weaker than old THPD, but this is intended.
Most gimmicks are in non-heroines(enemies or items), not in heroines.

I had to reduce the whole floor to 40, since almost everyone seeks short-length game, not long one.
As you see however, this game is highly inspired by touhou genso wanderer series and shiren 5.

If you think this game is hard, calm down, and see items in your inventory.

Warning: Saves prior to version 1.0.9 will not be compatible properly! If there is such a save, please delete it.

Anyway, please enjoy THPD: reloaded well!
