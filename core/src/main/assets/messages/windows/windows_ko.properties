windows.wndstory.id_1=The Hakurei Shrine (博麗神社 Hakurei Jinja) is a small, run-down Shinto shrine located on the Great Hakurei Barrier on the east side of Gensokyo. It's a key location that has appeared in many of the official games' prologues, stages, in character endings and in other official literature by ZUN. It's the home of the Touhou Project's protagonist: Reimu Hakurei.
windows.wndstory.id_2=The Misty Lake (霧の湖 Kiri no Mizuumi) is a large lake located at the foot of the Youkai Mountain. Many fairies and youkai alike appear to gather here, especially during the summertime, given the abundant water. The lake and its environs appear to be the home of Cirno, Daiyousei and Wakasagihime.
windows.wndstory.id_3=The Bamboo Forest of the Lost (迷いの竹林 Mayoi no Chikurin) is said to be located in the opposite direction to the Youkai Mountain when looking out from the Human Village. Legend has it that the forest was not originally a part of Gensokyo, but was washed over to Gensokyo by a big tsunami. Long long ago, the forest was known as Takakusa Commandery (高草郡 Takakusa Gun, literally "Tall Grass Commandery", an abolished administrative region in Inaba province in real life, now Tottori prefecture). Inside of it lies the mansion Eientei.
windows.wndstory.id_4=Youkai Mountain (妖怪の山 Youkai no Yama) is Gensokyo's largest mountain and volcano. As its name implies, it is inhabited almost exclusively by youkai, primarily kappa and tengu, and where humans are generally not welcome.
windows.wndstory.id_5=The Myouren Temple ( 命蓮寺 Myourenji), also the Palanquin Ship ( 聖輦船 Seirensen) or Treasure Ship Above the Clouds (雲上の宝船 Unjō no Takarabune), was originally a ship capable of sailing through the sky, where it was landed directly on top of the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum and renovated into a temple. In its original ship form, it was capable of traveling to Makai. The temple can still transform back into its ship form whenever Byakuren Hijiri chooses to.
windows.wndstory.id_6=The Moriya Shrine (守矢神社 Moriya Jinja) is a Shinto shrine, originally from the Outside World, that was transported to Gensokyo by the god Kanako Yasaka during the start of the events of Mountain of Faith. It is now located somewhere near the top of Youkai Mountain beside a neighboring Divine Lake that was brought with it.
windows.wndstory.id_7=The Rainbow Dragon Cave (虹龍洞 Kouryuudou) is a cavern located on Youkai Mountain. The cave also acts as a mining shaft.
windows.wndstory.id_8=Hakugyokurou (白玉楼, lit. "Tower of White Jade") is a ghost shrine overlooking the Netherworld. It is well known among the afterlife realms for its cherry blossom gardens, and many ghosts come to see them every spring.
windows.wndstory.id_9=The Lunar Capital (月の都 Tsuki no Miyako), or Lunatic Kingdom (ルナティックキングダム Runatikku Kingudamu), is a thriving, ancient metropolis and currently the only known one on the Moon, located on its far side. With its civilisation mostly having Lunarians and Moon Rabbits, its technology and weaponry is known to be far more advanced than that of the Outside World. The founder and lord of the capital is Lord Tsukuyomi. The Lunar Capital is also the legendary Dragon Palace (竜宮 Ryūgū), also called the Dragon King's Palace (竜宮城 Ryūgū-jō), that Mizue no Uranoshimako managed to reach, but it doesn't seem to be common knowledge since characters such as Rinnosuke Morichika still think of the Dragon Palace as a completely different place on the bottom of the sea.
windows.wndstory.id_10=Hell (地獄 Jigoku), also New Hell (新地獄 Shin Jigoku), is a collection of realms seperate from Gensokyo where sinful souls are imprisoned. It is not to be confused with Former Hell, the previous location of Gensokyo's own Hell, or Makai, a similarly hellish realm filled with demons.
